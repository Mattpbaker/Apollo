## How to Add Images

1. Save your cover image with the correct filename
2. Place it in this `/public/ventures/` folder
3. The image will automatically appear on the venture card and in the modal

The component will automatically handle the images once they're added. If an image is missing, it will show a placeholder with the venture name.
